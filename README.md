# SImpleSoundboard
A simple audio player which will create a soundboard for you based on your folder structure

Place the .exe file in the same folder as a folder containing the .wav files you wish your soundboard to play. Creating multiple of these folders and naming them accordingly will allow you to access multiple soundboards from the app.
